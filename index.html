				<p>Welcome to my website portfolio! I'm thrilled to have you here.

					I'm currently a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, diving deep into the world of algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms. Alongside my academic pursuits, I'm interning at Skysuite.ai, where I'm gaining valuable real-world experience in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
					
					In addition to my internship, I'm also actively involved in giving back to the community. I volunteer as a web developer at STEM Canada, where I contribute to projects aimed at fostering interest and education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Moreover, I serve as the Human Resources Vice President at UTMSAM (University of Toronto Society of Algorithmic Modeling), where I facilitate the growth and development of our organization's members.
					
					Beyond the world of bits and bytes, you'll often find me immersed in my hobbies. I'm an avid reader, constantly seeking new perspectives and knowledge. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I enjoy expressing myself through singing. To balance out my cerebral pursuits, I'm passionate about fitness and make it a priority to work out regularly.
					
					Coding isn't just a career path for me; it's a passion. I'm particularly fascinated by the possibilities that machine learning and AI offer, and I'm always eager to explore new techniques and applications in this field.
					
					Once again, thank you for visiting my page. Feel free to explore and reach out—I'm excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts, learners, and collaborators!</p>

					<h2>Navigating Huarongdao</h2>
					<h3>Python, State Search Algorithms</h3>
					<p>
						Ever tried cracking the Huarongdao puzzle? Back in elementary school, I'd spend hours immersed in it, relishing every challenge. In this showcase, I share how I conquered it with DFS and A* Search. I meticulously modeled each piece, creating a dynamic puzzle board. Tracking states was key for success. DFS explored every nook, while A* Search found the best routes. It's about more than a game—it's a nod to my Taiwanese roots, embracing cultural heritage. So, if you're seeking someone to tackle challenges with enthusiasm and creativity, let's chat and explore exciting opportunities together!

					<h2>City Classification Machine Learning Model</h2>
					<h3>Python, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib</h3>
			
					<p>

						Dive into the world of machine learning with my City Classification project. Leveraging Python's robust libraries such as Numpy, Sklearn, and Matplotlib, I crafted a cutting-edge KNN classifier. This model exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities, achieving an impressive 73 percent accuracy on unseen datasets.

						Throughout the project, I meticulously evaluated and fine-tuned various models, including decision trees and MLP, showcasing my proficiency in machine learning methodologies. Advanced techniques in hyperparameter tuning were employed to optimize model performance, demonstrating not only a mastery of machine learning but also my Python programming prowess. Join me on this journey of data-driven discovery!

					<h2>Adventure - Graphic Game</h2>
					<h3>Java, JavaFX, GitHub Git</h3>
					<p>
					

					Embark on an exhilarating adventure through my Graphic Game project! Using Java and JavaFX, I crafted an innovative Graphical User Interface (GUI) that seamlessly integrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with advanced design patterns like Builder, Decorator, and Strategy.

					Delving deeper into software architecture, I implemented Inversion of Control, Inheritance, Composition, and Polymorphism, ensuring a robust and scalable solution. Through effective collaboration and agile development methodologies, my team and I presented a captivating 10-minute demo, showcasing the game's extensive functionalities. Join me as we explore the exciting world of game development and unleash our creativity!
